This example lives in the package "org.parboiled.examples.java":http://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/tree/master/src/examples/java/org/parboiled/examples/java/ and showcases a full-blown Java 1.6 parser.

See the [[Java Examples]] page for instructions on how to easily run this example on your machine.

This examples demonstrates many of _parboileds_ features (no actions, however) and shows that _parboiled_ can handle even large and complex grammars, like the Java 1.6 grammar. The example code parses all java source files in the _parboiled_ source distribution and outputs some basic performance indicators like files, lines and characters parsed per second.

This Java 6 PEG grammar can give you many clues as to how effectively build larger PEG grammars and codify them in _parboileds_ internal java DSL. Parsing Java from Java has never been easier... :-)
