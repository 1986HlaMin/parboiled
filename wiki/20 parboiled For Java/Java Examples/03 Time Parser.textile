This example lives in the package "org.parboiled.examples.time":http://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/tree/master/src/examples/java/org/parboiled/examples/time/ and is a simple demo of a parser for time specifications in various, very relaxed formats.

See the [[Java Examples]] page for instructions on how to easily run this example on your machine.

This examples demonstrates how _parboiled_ can be used for tasks that would otherwise often be solved with regular expressions. Even though this _parboiled_ parser description is not the shortest in terms of lines of code it certainly is very readable and therefore easily maintained, enhanced, etc.
