Starting with release 0.9.8.0 _parboiled_ comes with a library variant called _parboiled for Scala_.
_parboild for Scala_ provides a concise internal Scala DSL for parser rule building that enables the use of the _parboiled_ parsing engine from Scala code without having to resort to the "clunky" (to the Scala eye) Java DSL and "heavy-lifting" parser extension.

_parboiled_ for Scala uses the exact same parsing engine for rule execution as _parboiled for Java_. The only difference lies in rule construction, which is done by special Scala DSL constructs. _parboiled for Scala_ offers the following advantages over its Java counterpart:

* More concise rule building DSL (making use of Scalas higher expressiveness)
* Increased type safety by hiding the parser value stack behind further abstractions (largely enabled by Scalas type inference)
* Faster initial rule building (no expensive parser extension step)
* Somewhat smaller library size (since parser extension logic is not required)
