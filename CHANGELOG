Version 0.9.0.0 (2010-01-22)
----------------------------
Major rewrite of action and parser extension infrastructure:
- Removed ActionResult interface, actions can now be arbitrary boolean expressions
- Removed now obsolete EQUALS, AND, OR, NOT as well as all CONVERT_XXX helpers
- Removed dependency on cglib, parboiled JAR now has no non-SDK dependencies
- Simplified running parboiled examples (now run via ANT) 

Version 0.8.5.0 (2010-01-18)
----------------------------
- Fixed IllegalStateException on trying to label a rule from within a recursion
- Fixed rare bug occurring in certain scenarios involving recursive test/testNot rules
- Improved reporting of parse errors, also renamed ParserConstructionException to GrammarException and
  ParsingException to ActionException, introduced ParserRuntimeException
- Enabled writing access to ParseError list returned by Context.getParseErrors()
- Inlined MatcherContext.runMatcher(boolean) for reduced stack footprint and cleaner stack traces

Version 0.8.4.0 (2010-01-07)
----------------------------
- Fixed incorrect ordering of action calls when several calls are present in one rule
- Fixed test/testNot rules throwing ParserConstructionException at EOI
- Added action helpers: EQUALS, AND, OR, NOT, NEXT_CHAR, NODE_BY_LABEL and NODES_BY_LABEL
- Added Time and RPN example (thanks to Reinier Zwitserloot from http://projectlombok.org for the RPN code) 
- Added Action interface enabling stand-alone action objects within rule creation expressions
- Added SplitParserTest, testing splitting of one grammar into several parser objects
- Simplified ActionParameter infrastructure, now allows casting of action parameters
- Changed access of BaseParser.toRule(s) from private to protected to allow for easy conversion of custom objects

Version 0.8.3.0 (2009-12-15)
----------------------------
- Improved parsing speed by factor 4 after first basic CPU profiling
- Added @SkipInPredicates annotation for action methods

- Added some more parser structure validation checks
- Improved customizability of parse tree printouts
- Improved naming of firstOf-rules in parse errors and parse tree printing
- Updated SparqlParser example

Version 0.8.1.0 (2009-12-07)
----------------------------
- Fixed definition of special characters to be fully compatible with the unicode standard
- Fixed IllegalStateException during parse error recovery of testNot() rules
- Added support for case independent matching of characters and strings
- Added SPARQL parser example (incl. test), thanks to Ken Wenzel from http://www.iwu.fraunhofer.de
